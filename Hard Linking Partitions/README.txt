The batch scripts were written to make it easier for a user with a fresh Windows operating system install and want to save 
space on their system drive for various reasons. One of the files is a program that is very user-friendly and easy
to navigate through. The other file is not to be run as a batch file as unwanted results could occur. It is to be copy and pasted 
step-by-step. 

The reasoning for creating this program was because I remember when I did this on my PC I had a heck of a time following 
how to do it correctly and had to freshly install my operating system several times which isn't too healthy. You can use 
this program to assist in your endeavors in saving space on a partition of your choice.

How the program works:
This program works by copying all of the system folders off of your system partition to another partition of your choice.
Then it removes the system folders on the system partition and then J-Links the folders from the partition that the 
system folders were copied to.
